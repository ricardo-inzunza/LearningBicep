Learning Azure Bicep

Things to note
1) You need a few requirements to get set up with Azure Bicep in Visual Studio Code
    One thing is to get logged in to your Microsoft Azure account
    The best way to do this is to install Azure Account Extension
    I got stuck on the step to setup the account before being able to open a Azure Cloud Shell (Powershell) Terminal
    To solve this, in VS Code, hit Clt + Shift+ P -> Then select Login
    I don't know why I was stuck or why this fixes it but hey, I'll take it.
